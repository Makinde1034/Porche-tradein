# DwaaS - Dealer as a Service

> Frontend implementation of DwaaS build with Vue [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue) powered with Vite [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vite.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite)

## Setting up the Dev Environment

### Install packages

To be able to install all packages related to [Porsche Design System](https://designsystem.porsche.com/v2/components/color/usage) please run `npm run setup` first. This will prompt a login to the registry to authenticate.

This command will automatically install all the packages after authentications is done.

### env variables

In order to define the target path of the build output you can add a `.env.local` file to the main dwaas folder. This is ignored by git so this file stays on your machine but itâ€™s not checked in.

You can set the following environment variables there:

| env variable           | default | description                                                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_DWAAS_DIST_DIR`  | `dist`  | an absolute or relative path to the output folder of the build process                          |
| `VITE_DWAAS_BASE_PATH` | `/`     | the base path where the script is stored on the server relative to the root path of the server. |

> To test the solution on directly on your Sitecore instance, this env viariables needs to point to `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\<yourinstance>\\public` path

## Develop

You can run the following npm scripts like `npm run <scriptname>`

| script     | description                                                                                                          |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`      | This will create a watchable version of Vite build without minification or bundle analysis under Sitecore instance   |
| `build`    | This will create a local production of Vite build                                                                    |
| `build:CI` | This command is meant to create a production bundle to be use by Sitecore instance, is used in Production deployment |
